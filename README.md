# Clinic-Managment-System-C-
This is a small system for health clinic, where patients can make appointments and visit the doctors for various ailments. The record of all patients and doctors will be maintained in this system. If a patient visits clinic first time, then his/her details will be added in the system and then appointment will be made on the basis of age (less than 12 years child specialist) and ailment (fever, cough, wound – general physicians, Joint pain, broken bone – Orthopedic etc. ). If the record of a patient already exist then appointment will be made on previous ID. If a patient visits clinic and an appointment is already made then after taking fee the appointment status is changed to complete and patient’s history is updated by adding new record to it, similarly doctor’s visited patients list will be updated.
